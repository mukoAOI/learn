If I knew it would be the last time I'd see you fall asleep,
I would tuck you in more tightly and "pray the lord , your soul to keep".
If I knew it would be the last time I'd see you walk out the door,
I would give you a hug and kiss you, and call you back for more.
If I knew it would be the last time I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise.
I would video tape each action and word , so I could play them back day after day.
If I knew it would be the last time I could spare an extra minute or so to stop and say"I love you, "instead of assuming you would know I do.
If I knew it would be the last time I would be there so share you day,
I'm sure you'll have so many more, so I can let just this one slip away.
For surely there's slways tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and certainly there's another chance to make everthing right.
There will always be another day, to say "I love you", and certainly there's another chance to say our"anything I can do?"
But, just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get,
I'd like to say how much I love you, and I hope we never forget.
Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike, and today may be the last chance you get to hold your love tight.
So, if you'er waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today?
For, if tomorrow never comes, you'll surely regret the day...
That you didn't take that extra time for a smile, a huge, or a kiss, and you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish.
So, hold your loved ones close today, and whisper in their ear, that you love them very much and you'll always hold them dear.
Take time to say"I'm sorry", "please forgive me", "thank you"or""it's okay.
And if tomorrow never comes, you'll have no regrets about today.
