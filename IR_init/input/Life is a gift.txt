Today before you think of saying an unkind word,
Think of someone who can't speak.
Before you complain about the taste of your food,
Think of someone who has nothing to eat.
Before you complain about your husband or wife,
Think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion.
Today before you complain about life,‘Think of someone who went too early to heaven.’
But before you think of pointing your finger or condemning another,
Remember that not one of us is without sin and we all answer to one maker.
And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down,
Put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around.
Life is a gift,
Enjoy it,
Celebrate it,
And fulfill it...
And while you want to give love to someone today,
Love someone with what you do and the words you say，
Love is not meant to be kept locked inside of us and hidden,
So give it away" Give love to someone today!"
